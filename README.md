# Basic-WebDev-Learning-Projects
An repository containing the project and websites I developed while learning Web Development.

TinDog is a design of imaginary website which provides a platform for Dogs to Date. Just like "tinder" for "dog".

Developed By Siddharth Singh. (PS: Not original ideas and no original designs, part of learning WebDev.)
